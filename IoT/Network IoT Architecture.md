IoT is all about data generated by sensors and how that data is used.

the foundational concept of all IoT architectures is supporting data, process and the functions that endpoint devices perform.

OSI and TCP/IP are useful architectures for an IoT network

## IoT Model

the IoT reference model (7 layers):
- 7 - collaboration & processes (people, and business processes)
- 6 - Application (reporting, analytics, control)
- 5 - data abstraction (aggregation and access)
- 4 - data accumulation (storage)
- 3 - edge computing (data element analysis and transformation)
- 2 - connectivity (communication and processing units)
- 1 - Physical Devices & controllers (the things in IoT)

# Bottom Layers

used to generate data from sensors 
## Layer 1

purpose:
- send/receive information
- primary function to generate data
- capable of being queried/controlled over a network

## Layer 2

purpose:
- connectivity focused
- reliable/timely data transmission
	- between layer 1 devices and network
	- between network and information processing at layer 3 (edge computing)

functions:
- communications between layer 1 devices
- reliable delivery of information
- switching and routing
- translation between protocols
- network layer security

## Layer 3

- referred to as the "fog" layer
- data reduction and converting network data flows into information ready for storage and processing by higher layers
- processing data close to edge of network
- data assessments to check predefined threshold for actions

functions:
- evaluate & reformat data for processing at higher levels
- filter data to reduce traffic higher level processing
- assess data for altering, notification or other actions

## Upper layers

upper layers deal with handling and processing the IoT data generated by the bottom layers

## Layer 4

- captures data
- stores data
	- for use by applications when necessary

## Layer 5

- reconciles multiple data formats
- ensures consistent semantics from various sources

## Layer 6

- interpret data using software
- may monitor, control and provide reports based on data analysis

## Layer 7

- consumes application information
- shares application information
- can change business processes
- delivers the benefits if IoT

# IoT Levels

4. Applications
3. Application Services Platform
2. Network
1. Devices
## Network Level

the IoT network level derives layers from the TCP/IP Layers:
- Transport
- Internet
- Network Interface

# Core IoT Functional Stack

## Applications

- needs to process the collected data
- controls smart objects when necessary
- make intelligent decisions based on collected information
- in response instruct things or other systems
	- to adapt to analyzed conditions and change their behaviors or parameters

smart objects exchange information with other systems, also applications exchange information with smart objects

applications use the following types of modules:
- Analytics Application
	- collects data
	- processes collected data
	- display information resulting from processed data
- Control Applications
	- control behavior of smart objects or related object to smart object
	- useful for controlling IoT network with logic
## Communications Network

communications layer is broken into four sublayers.
if objects not self-contained and need to communicate with an external system. they communicate using wireless technology.
#### Access network

- uses wireless technologies
	- 802.11ah
	- 802.15.4g
	- LoRa

 range between smart object and information collector is key parameter of selection of access technology:
 
 - PAN - a few meters (bluteooth)
 - HAN - few tens of meters (ZigBee, bluetooth low energy (BLE))
 - NAN - few hundreds of meters
 - FAN - several tens of meters to several hundred meters (open space, not secured and not controlled)
 - LAN - up to 100m
 - MAN - up to a few kilometers
 - WAN - more then a few kilometers

Three main topologies

#### Gateways and backhaul

- gateway 
	- directly communicates with smart objects
	- forwards collected data through longer-range medium (backhaul) to central station for information processing
	- acts as router
		- forwards ip packets from one network to another

#### IP transport

- for successful communication
	- IP and UDP must be implemented
	- supports variety of devices to connect and media to use

#### Operations and management sublayers

- additional protocols implemented
	- allowing headend applications to exchange data with sensors
		- examples - CoAP MQTT
- push model - sensor reports at a regular interval on a local trigger
- pull model - an applications queries the sensor over the network
- hybrid models
- Some IoT implementers HTTP, WebSocket, CoAP, MQQT


## Things: Sensors and Actuators

- different types of physical devices
- deployed
- provide and/or exchange information to external systems/management platform

smart objects can be classified:
- battery powered or power connected
- mobile or static
- frequency - of reporting parameter. constraints the possible power source and transmission range
- simple or rich data
- range - based on distance which gateway is located
- object density per cell

# Data Versus Network Analytics

#### Data analytics
- process data collected by smart objects
- combines data to provide an intelligent  view related to the IoT system:
	- basic level, dashboard display an alarm due to sensor information

#### Network analytics
- concerned with network connectivity
- network efficiency
- lasting loss of connectivity may result in an accident or degradation of operations efficiency


# Data Management Layers

#### Edge layer

data management within the sensors themselves

#### Fog layer

data management in the gateways and transit network

#### Cloud layer

data management in the cloud or central data center
