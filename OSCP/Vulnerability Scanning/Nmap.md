NSE scripts can be categorized as:
- safe and vuln (doesn't affect stability)
- intrusive and vuln (can affect stability)

you can check these properties with `cat /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db | grep \"\"vuln\""`

### NSE

`sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "vuln" 192.168.50.124` - an example of running all the scripts in the category "vuln" and running those nse scripts against https. the `-sV` providing the service information will also help the NSE vuln scripts


### Open Source NSE

we can find open source nse scripts for specific cve that we wish to scan for in places like GitHub.

These scripts always need to be vetted before downloading and running as they may be malicious.

1. search for the `<cve> nse` in a search engine to see if we can find one to use.
2. save it to `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/<new script>` - make sure to follow the name conventions of other similar scripts.
3. `sudo nmap --script-updatedb` - update the nmap db to reflect the new script added.
4. `sudo nmap -sV -p 443 --script "http-vuln-cve2021-41773" 192.168.50.124` - example of using the new script

curl can be useful for checking PoCs as the browser does not always work.
