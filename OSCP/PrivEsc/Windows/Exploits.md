We can use public exploits to gain PrivEsc, including kernel exploits.

A lot of the time we will need to gain access to users with appropriate Se privileges to gain privesc via an exploit.

Commonly when we gain access to a system via the web, we will gain access to a local system user - a lot of the time these users will have Se privs that we can utilizes to esc our privs. This can be check with `whoami /priv`

We can also leverage installed applications that may have vulnerabilities and public exploits available.

`SeImpersonatePrivilege` - this priv is very useful for gaining access to more privileged users from lower prived system users.

TODO: research how this works with named pipes and research the below tools



### SeImpersonatePrivilege
#### Tools

https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Potatoes_Windows_Privesc

- PrintSpoofer
- RottenPotato
- SweetPotato
- JuicyPotato

#### PrintSpoofer

this privesc requires SeImpersonate

`wget https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer/releases/download/v1.0/PrintSpoofer64.exe` download from github and then transfer binary to target machine

`.\PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c powershell.exe` - execute to privesc


### SeBackupPrivilege

if a user is part of the `Backup Operators` windows system group we can utilize this privilege even if it is disabled.

we can copy any system folders - including the SAM with something like robocopy

`robocopy /b "SOURCE_DIRECTORY" "DEST_DIRECTORY"` 


#### Hints

always google and research windows system groups, they may have privileges enabled by default even if their privileges say that it is disabled.
