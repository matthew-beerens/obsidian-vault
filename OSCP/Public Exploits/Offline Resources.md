`Metasploit` is an excellent framework built to assist in the development and execution of exploits. It was created by H D Moore in 2003 and is owned by Rapid7. It allows for easy execution of pre-loaded exploits with minor configuration settings. This framework has a free community edition and a paid pro version. We will cover Metasploit in detail in a later Module, but it is important to be aware of this exploit framework.

`Core Impact` is another exploit framework owned by HelpSystems and there are no free versions for this framework. This framework can automate testing, link to vulnerability scanners, complete phishing campaigns, and re-test exploited systems to verify remediation was completed after a penetration test.

`Canvas`, made by Immunity, is another exploit framework. Once the product is paid for, exploits are regularly updated every month.

`The Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)` is a penetration testing tool focused on client-side attacks executed within a web browser.

`searchsploit` - local repository of exploitdb. `sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb` - before each assessment.

`grep Exploits /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse` - nmap NSE has scripts that can execute exploits
`nmap --script-help=clamav-exec.nse` - can be used to for help using an NSE script to exploit
