To avoid compilation issues, it is recommended to use native compilers for the specific operating system targeted by the code - this may not always be an option.

We may only have access to a kali environment to we will need to install tools to help us cross-compile our exploit.

#### Cross-compilation

1. `sudo apt install mingw-w64` - install mingw a c compiler for windows. which can compile code into Windows Portable Executable (PE) file.

2. `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe` - compile our exploit into an exe. 

3. Determine if we have any errors during out compilation. If we find errors research why they occured and how to fix them. This exploit contained winsock2 which requires the following fix.

4. `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe -l ws2_32` - this will load the winsock2 DLL and enable us to compile - this is called stack linking.

5. `wine syncbreeze_exploit.exe` - run the binary
