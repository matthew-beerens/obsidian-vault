Used to obtain operating system and  browser information from a target in a non-routable internal network.

https://canarytokens.org/generate - used for finger printing client side of target. - results can change if an adblocker is in place.

`We could also use an online IP logger like _Grabify_[9](https://portal.offsec.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/client-side-attacks/target-reconnaissance/client-fingerprinting#fn9) or JavaScript fingerprinting libraries such as _fingerprint.js_`


#### Fingerprinting

We could use `theHarvester` tool to harvest a promising email address. 

As a client-side attack we could use an HTML Application (HTA) attached to an email to execute code in the context of internet explorer or Microsoft Edge. This is a popular approach.

We can use Canarytokens to obtain information about a targets `IP address, browser and operating system`. This was we can verify OS and Browser to tailor an attack.

#### Creating Pretext for Attack

To ensure this attack is not a waste of time, we should attempt to create a pretext as it is difficult to convince people to randomly click on links. 

e.g. Our target works in finance department. 

In this case would could mention we received and invoice with a financial error and offer a link to view the error - which is a conarytoken.
