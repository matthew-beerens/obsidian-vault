We can make use of the Netcraft `searchdns` tool to gather information about the target domain. For each result from the DNS search we can view a site report for information about the server.

from `site reports` we can find information about the `site technoloiges` including:
-  application servers
- server-side technologies
- client-side technologies 
- client-side scripting frameworks
- content delivery networks (CDN)

The list of subdomains and technologies will provide useful information as we move onto active information gathering.
