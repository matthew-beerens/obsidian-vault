Using online tools and resources to passively gather information.

open source projects and online repositories:
- GitHub
- GitHub Gist
- GitLab
- SourceForge

we can use google dorking to search these online repositories.

### GitHub

we can use search properties in githubs search bar to limit search results:
- owner: - search repositories that belong to a specific vendor
- path: - to search for any files with the word in the filename (e.g. `path:users`)

### Automated searching (for bigger repos)

Gitrob and Gitleaks can be used to automate searching larger repos for sensitive information.
