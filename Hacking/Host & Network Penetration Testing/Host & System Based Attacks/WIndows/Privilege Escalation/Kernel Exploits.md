Need a meterpreter shell on target user

Brief
=
- core of operating system (Windows NT), in control of resources, io
- increased likely hood of crashing
- Windows-Exploit Suggester Github 
- Windows-Kernel-Exploits Github secwiki HAS PREBUILT BINARIES
- operates in user mode and kernel mode

Methodology
=
1. gain access to system user with meterpreter shell
2. check the privilege's of user
3. background meterpreter session and run exploit suggester msf module
	1. or you can follow windows exploit suggester py script below
4. research exploits with rapid7
5. use msfmodule to exploit


Meterpreter
=
getprivs - display user privilege's 
getsystem - attempt to pwn system for root
systeminfo - provides syystem information for exploit suggester python script
upload - uploads file to system

Metasploit
=
`post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` - background the session and run it on the session to suggest exploits - make use of rapid7 to research the exploits

Windows Exploit Suggester (py script)
=
clone the git repository
1. copy all the information from meterpreter `systeminfo` and save to txt file
2. run txt file throught suggester script.py
	1. run `./windows-exploit-suggester.py --update` - update the vuln db for script
	2. run `./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database <latest xlsx database> --systeminfo <txt file from systeminfo>`
	3. exploits listed at top of output are most likely to succeed in exploiting
		1. can make use of secwiki windows-kernel-exploits search for the cve,
3. upload exploit into temp directory
4. make use of exploit
