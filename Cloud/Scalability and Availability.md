scalability and availability are some of the leading reasons for companies to move to the cloud

### Regional Computing

enables you to deploy workloads into regions/countries around the world when needed, apply data fencing and policies per region, specific rules and separate data based on regions
there is so much infrastructure available world wide, it enables a massive amount of coverage

### Scalability

workload can run over several vms and all the vms can scale base on compute power needed through autoscale. autoscale can add vms and compute power.

lambdas can also be scaled with autoscaling

you can add rules to scaling to treat workload how you would like to

### Availability

being able to run multiple instances of a workload, and making use of a load balancer 
ensuring services are always available

spread workloads across different availability zone which are essentially different data centers within the same region this creates fault tolerance in a region incase data centers go down or other issues

there is also global availability when using availability zones in multiple regions world wide
