Cloud Economic
=

### Storage
can add and remove storage capacity as needed, no need to buy more hardware

### Compute/Networking
can add more compute power capacity as needed without needing to buy a lot of new hardware when it is needed and then having unused compute capacity when demands go away


CapEx vs OpEx
=

### On-premises capacity expansion = capital expense

- purchasing equipment and licensing cost up front
- depreciate and replacing equipment
- renewing licenses

### Cloud-base capacity expansion = operational expense

- billed monthly for what is used
- no equipment purchase
- may or may not require license purchase

### Capacity reduction

On-premises - possible sell excess equipment
Cloud - reduce monthly cost


Consumption based spending
=

### Capacity-based spending
- on-premises resources
- some cloud resources - virtual machines

### Consumption based spending
- pay for what is used
- functions, lambda
- services
- storage
- harder to predict and budget for
- optimizing cost metrics

there are auto scale abilities to provide scaling for capacity when needed

Functional Advantages
=
- provisioning environments takes minutes
	- no capital expenditure 
	- streamlined process
- built in access and allocation management
- reduced administrative overhead 

Drawbacks
=
- there are existing investments - may have in excess of equipment that costs alot of money, cloud would make it redundant 
- on-going operations expenses
- data fencing - protecting sensitive, wanting to keep it inhouse
- regulatory compliance
