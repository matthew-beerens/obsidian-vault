SLA = service level agreements

### Cloud Resource responsibility Model

everything management plane and below the platform provider is responsible for ( managment place, virtualization, physical infrastructure, physical facility )

everything above is responsibility of yourself (virtual machines, services, workload)

**This all depends on the service provided above is the base line**

for example with plaform as a service, you will still be responsible for the workload, but everything below will be up to the provider to manage and take responsibility for

baseline SLA for the big 3 are 99.99% uptime for virtual machines - check out the different SLAs if need from their websites

### Cloud Support

there are different tiers of support for each platform, which are all very similar
basic is free and then there are 3 premium lvls of support 

support can be provided through service tickets


*make sure you understand the SLAs when commiting to a cloud provider and understand the support you will receive when its need, this is really important*

the purpose of an SLA is to gaurentee an amount of service uptime, allow access to support services and outlining account credit process
